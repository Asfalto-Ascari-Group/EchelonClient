**Echelon Information**
Project Echelon has been under development for a couple of months now; Echelons' main goal is to minimize the effort required to carry out racing events in Assetto Corsa.

In addition to this, it will supply the user with extra on-screen information that becomes handy such as, upcoming Asfalto Ascari events, current user account details, and more coming soon.

**How to Use Echelon**

1. If you haven't already, Install Echelon via this [GitHub link](https://github.com/Asfalto-Ascari-Group/EchelonClient-Release-Stable/releases/tag/BetaRelease) (You are here already, So just scroll down and download the .ZIP folder)

2. Unzip the `.ZIP` folder and open `Echelon.exe`.

3. Mount your `assettocorsa` steam installation path in the "Synchronise" settings.

4. Choose a racing series and synchronize your respective content.

**Q&A**

*How do I know what racing series to synchronize, for the race I am participating in?*

> In the follow-up Email, Discord notification, Verbally said or general knowledge; it would be stated what series you are to choose for the respective event. In other words, We will make sure you know otherwise you can just ask us.

*Is Asfalto Ascari able to see my computer and its vital information such as IP addresses, MAC addresses, or file directories stored on it?*

> No. The only information Echelon currently gathers is the connection ID of each client and the options you choose in-app. That is all.

*What should I do when a new Echelon version is released?*

> You would be contacted via Discord, Email, etc. You should then navigate to the designated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Asfalto-Ascari-Group/EchelonClient-Release-Stable/releases/tag/BetaRelease) (you are here already) and download the latest version. (Available below this text block) In later versions, this will all be done automatically in-app by Echelon, itself.

*Who should I get in touch with (and how) to report a bug?*

> Read Below.

**How to Report a Bug**
Project Echelon is finally in a working state, but there are still a few kinks we must iron out. To mitigate these issues, we (Asfalto Ascari) have taken on users who are advised to test Echelon rigorously until it meets our standards. We also encourage users to report all bugs that are encountered when using Echelon. This also helps out the developer(s) of Echelon much more than you think.

*Forms of contact to report a bug -*

* [Asfalto Ascari Discord Server](https://discord.gg/q8mk86rucw). **
* Developer Discord Tag / <span style="color:purple">`brendanprice#5419`</span>.
* Email / <span style="color:blue">`Developer@AsfaltoAscari.com`</span>.


** All bugs should be directed towards `brendanprice#5419` or to `#general`.
